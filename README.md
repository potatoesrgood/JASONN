A new, open source, virtual assistant. It is made entirely with python. I you have any questions, please feel free to comment those questions. (currently only for mac, I'm working on the windows installation)  

# Installation
    git clone https://github.com/potatoesrgood/JASONN.git

# SETUP
    cd JASONN 
    python Setup.py
    
Drag jason.py into your home directory
  
# Setting Up a Shortcut (Optional)
    nano .bash_profile
   
Put the next line at the top of the script:
   
    alias Jasonn='python jason.py'
  
Now do "control-o", "enter", and then "control-x"
  
    source ~/.bash_profile
